                      Contrail One is based on handmade sans-serif letters seen on UK posters. The slight slant and bouncy quality suggest the emerging jet age, and a state of excited anticipation. The rounded corners give it an approachable friendly feeling. As a low contrast design it is suitable for use in medium to large sizes, including headlines. This font was made specifically to be used as web type.

                      Flow is a font family built for abstracting content and code for design mockups, wireframing, presentations, and websites. It's not perfect, but neither are your wireframes. Flow has sub-pixels, artifacts, overlaps and other imperfections.

                      Press Start 2P is a bitmap font based on the font design from 1980s Namco arcade games. It works best at sizes of 8px, 16px and other multiples of 8. Although the design of uppercase letters and digits dates back to Atari's "Sprint" (1977), the specific glyph forms in this TrueType conversion are based on those from "Return of Ishtar" (1986), one of the first games to include and regularly use lowercase as well as uppercase letters in its screen font. Unlike the original font from the "Return of Ishtar" ROM, Press Start 2P includes a wide variety of non-ASCII Unicode characters for pan-European use, including Greek and Cyrillic. It could be expanded to support other scripts.

                      Pragati Narrow is a libre Devanagari typeface family designed as a complement to Archivo Narrow. It is a sans-serif family with vertical and horizontal cuts. Pragati Narrow comes in 2 weights (Regular and Bold) and was specially developed for screen as webfont and desktop font, too. The Devanagari was designed by Marcela Romero, Pablo Cosgaya and Nicolás Silva. The Latin version of Pragati is reminiscent of late nineteenth century American typefaces. It includes four Narrow styles and four Normal styles (in development), was derived from Chivo (designed by Héctor Gatti) and was developed with the collaboration of the Omnibus-Type team. Pragati (प्रगति) is the Hindi word for progress.This project is led by Omnibus-Type, a type foundry based in Argentina.
